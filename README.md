# Python-based-Automated-Invoices-and-Quotations-Generator

This is a Python-based desktop application that allows users to generate professional invoices or quotations in PDF format using either a Graphical User Interface (GUI) or a Command Line Interface (CLI). The system supports customer input, itemized billing, automatic calculations, watermarking (INVOICE/QUOTATION, PAID/UNPAID), and stores all records in a **MySQL database**.


## Features

- **Dual Interface**: Use either GUI (`GUI_app.py` via `tkinter`) or CLI (`CLI_main.py`)
- **Auto-formatted PDF** invoices with watermarking
- **Dynamic Discount and Tax** (Flat or % based)
- **Data Persistence** with MySQL using `mysql-connector-python` and `pymysql`
- **Company Logo and Watermark Support**
- **Invoices folder** to store generated PDFs
- GUI preview image (`GUI.png`)
